# Particles
The assignment was to implement particle effect. Calculation of the particle's position is done on compute shader for better performance. The example shows 100k particles falling from the top of the fountain and 1 million particles moving on the bottom of the fountain.

## Build instructions

Sample also requires assets and shaders contained in this repository. Run the sample from build directory as paths to assets and shaders are setup to be run from there or move them to appropriate location.

### Windows

Dependencies
- CMake 3.14+
- Visual Studio 2017 or above

Generate Visual Studio 2017 project:
```
cmake -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -H. -Bbuild
